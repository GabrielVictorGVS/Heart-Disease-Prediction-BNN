# Heart Disease Prediction BNN

A simple binary classification neural network to classify patients from the Cleveland Hearth Disease Dataset as either "sick" or "healthy" based on their personal habits and exam results.

This model served as a introductory project to my AI predictive model studies.

## Notes

- The implemented model includes properties that can be adjusted through command-line interface (CLI) arguments.
